🧠 International Debt Analysis using SQL Workbench

Role: Data Analyst | Tools: MySQL, SQL Workbench/J, Excel

📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes international debt data for the years 2023–2024, focusing on short-term, long-term, and total external debt for 10 countries.
It demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) pipeline using SQL — from importing raw CSV files to generating analytical insights through SQL queries.

⚙️ Key Steps

Created the database schema international_debt and imported CSV datasets directly into MySQL using SQL Workbench/J.

Performed data cleaning — handled missing values, standardized ISO codes, and validated debt totals.

Built clean analytical tables with derived metrics such as short-term debt percentage of total debt.

Developed 20 SQL queries ranging from basic aggregations to advanced CASE logic and multi-table joins.

Created summary views for easy comparison of short-term vs. long-term debt ratios.

Indexed key columns to optimize query performance.
